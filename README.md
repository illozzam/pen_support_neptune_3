# Samsung Cell Phone Pen Holder

This repository contains the design files and instructions for 3D printing a pen holder for Samsung cell phones, designed to fit the display of an Elegoo Neptune 3 3D printer. It might also work for other models, but this has not been tested.

## Motivation

I frequently use the cell phone pen on the Neptune 3's display, but it often falls into inaccessible areas or I end up losing the pen. So I designed this holder.

## Features

- **Compatibility:** Samsung cell phones with a pen (S Pen).
- **3D Printer:** Elegoo Neptune 3.
- **Recommended Material:** PLA, PETG, or ABS.

## Project Images
